# GenderSynthesizer
Synth coded in C++, using the JUCE Framwork! Just create a Juce Project and import the files in this folder.

First, Create a Juce Project (documentation here: https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_new_projucer_project.html) and replace your source folder with the source folder here! Target your VST folder in your preferred DAW. There are parameters for choosing a sound wave (sine, saw, and square), as well as for modifying the ADSR Envelope for the oscillator. You can also use FM synthesis to modulate your waves by changing the frequency and resonance of the modulator, and finally, modify the ADSR envelope of the modulator itself. 

This was one of my first projects with JUCE, and I still have a lot of documentation to pour over, as well as C++ skills to brush up on. I'm hoping to create some more advanced VSTs in the future!
